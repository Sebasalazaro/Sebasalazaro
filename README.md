## 🧠 About me

I’m a **Web Application Penetration Tester** with a strong background in **full-stack software development and cloud infrastructure**.

I currently work in a **US-based cybersecurity consulting environment**, performing security assessments for **enterprise and Fortune 500 applications**.  
Before focusing fully on security, I built and deployed cloud-native web applications end-to-end, which lets me approach pentesting from a **developer’s perspective**.

Outside of work, I’m into **anime, games, and medieval fantasy** — I like systems, worlds, and mechanics, whether they’re digital or fictional.
